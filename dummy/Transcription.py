Hi, thank you for seeing us today. Gigi’s been drinking so much more water than usual lately, and she’s peeing all the time. I’m starting to get worried.
I see, that’s definitely something worth checking. How long have you noticed this increase in thirst and urination?
Maybe two weeks now. At first, I thought it was just the heat, but it’s getting worse. She doesn’t even finish her food anymore.
Has she lost any weight recently? Or does she seem more tired than usual?
Yes, both. She sleeps all day and her fur looks duller than before. I thought it was just because she’s getting older.
That’s understandable. Older cats often show subtle changes at first. Let me take a look at her, and we’ll also review her bloodwork.

…

Okay, I’ve finished the exam, and I’ve gone through her lab results. Gigi’s creatinine and SDMA levels are a bit higher than normal, and her urine is more dilute than it should be. These signs suggest early chronic kidney disease.
Chronic kidney disease? That sounds serious. Is she in pain?
Not necessarily pain, but she might feel a bit nauseous or tired sometimes. Her kidneys aren’t filtering waste from her blood as efficiently as before, which makes her drink more to flush things out.
So it’s like her body’s trying to fix it on its own?
Exactly. Her system is compensating, but the kidneys can’t keep up forever. The good news is that we caught it early. With the right care, many cats live comfortably for years with CKD.
Did I do something wrong? Could I have prevented it?
No, not at all. This isn’t your fault. Kidney disease in cats is very common as they age. It can be related to genetics, past infections, or even dental issues. What matters now is how we manage it.

What can I do for her?
First, I recommend switching her to a special kidney diet. It’s lower in phosphorus and has just the right amount of protein to reduce strain on her kidneys.
Will she even eat that? She’s the pickiest cat I know.
You’re not alone there. Many cats take time to adjust. Try mixing a bit of the new food with her current one, and gradually increase it over a week or two. Warming it up slightly can help too — it brings out the smell.
Alright, I’ll try. Anything else I should be doing?
Yes. I’d like you to start giving her subcutaneous fluids twice a week. It helps her stay hydrated and supports kidney function. I know it sounds scary, but I’ll show you exactly how it’s done before you go.
Oh, I don’t know if I can do that myself.
I promise, most people feel nervous at first, but after a couple of tries, it becomes routine. Gigi might even get used to it quickly. It’ll help her feel more energetic and comfortable.
How soon will I notice a difference?
Usually within a few days of proper hydration. She might start eating better and acting more alert.

Is there any medication she’ll need?
Not right now, but we’ll monitor her phosphorus and potassium levels. If they go up, we might add a phosphate binder or a potassium supplement. I’ll also suggest omega-3 fish oil to support her kidneys and reduce inflammation.
Can this disease be reversed?
Unfortunately, no. The kidneys can’t regenerate. But the goal is to slow the progression and keep her quality of life high. Cats with early CKD can do really well for a long time if managed carefully.
That’s a bit of a relief. I just want her to be happy.
And she can be. Keep an eye on her appetite, water intake, and weight. Maybe jot it down in a notebook or on your phone each week so we can track patterns.

Okay. What should I watch for in case things get worse?
Good question. If she suddenly stops eating, vomits frequently, becomes very lethargic, or her thirst increases dramatically, let me know right away. We can adjust her fluids or medications as needed.
Should I keep her activity normal?
Yes, let her decide what feels right. Gentle play, brushing, and comfort are more important than strict routines. She’ll let you know how she feels.
I just hate the thought of her being sick.
I know. But remember, CKD doesn’t mean suffering — it means being proactive. You’re giving her the best chance to feel good for as long as possible.

Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
You’re very welcome. I can tell you love her deeply. Gigi’s lucky to have such a devoted parent.
We’ll do whatever it takes. When should we come back?
Let’s schedule a follow-up in about a month to recheck her kidney values. If you notice any big changes before then, call right away.
Got it. Thank you, really.
Of course. We’ll do a quick demo of the fluids now so you feel confident, and I’ll send you home with the new food samples.
Alright. Gigi, did you hear that? We’re going to take care of you.
That’s the spirit. You’ve got this — and so does she.

As they gathered their things and prepared to leave, the soft sound of Gigi’s purring filled the room, a small but hopeful sign that she was still very much herself.
